This project was not too bad.  Though it did start to feel a little tedious since Im not a very creative person. I just threw some skeletons in there and called it spooky house or something like that. 

Biggest issue with this project was figuring out how to write html. What I got from this was that html uses lots of tags for everything. Pretty much every single thing you do has a tag. Tags for text formating, colors of the webpage, bolding, line breaks - all tags. I didnt really know what I was doing when I wrote my html so I just trialed and errored a bunch of stuff until it started doing what I wanted.

I copied the urev file into my directory and gave chmod'd it so I could edit it.  I scrolled through it until I found the message you get when you have not waited two hours and commented out that little check thingy. Now I can do it without the time limit, so thats nice. The actual stuff you do when you run urev is fairly simple, and you can start doing it fast/on autopilot once you just remember what each combination is instead of just adding them up every time.
