So for this project we had to use the gd library to create a circle made out of squares. I didn't really think about it too much because it seemed as simple as making a loop, but it didnt really work out that way. The first time I thought I had done it I ended up with a diamond. Then I realized I needed to think about the distance from the midpoint, and not the x y coordinates.  So I loaded in the math library and used the eqauation for all points on a circle, which is x^2 + y^2 = radius^2. Since I knew either x and radius and y and radius, I created two seperate point creating tools. One calculated the y coordinate for a given x, in increments of 12. The other calculated the x coordinate from the given y. This helped fill in the many gaps in the circle that were left by using the provided x values alone. 

Another thing that caused issues was the fact that I was not creating a circle from the point 0,0.  I had to make sure I was subtracting the real value of x from the user given midpoint. If you forget to do that, the formula I used will not work.
